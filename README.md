# What is UniChallenge?
An action organized by people from Athens University of Economics and Business.

# What do we do?
Our purpose is to create a way, through which we can get more aware of our university's problems and find solutions to the everyday, small issues we might be facing.

# How do we do it?
We make groups, find problems and create solutions to improve our university.

# Our team
We are students from all of AUEB's departments with willingness to contribute and improve our everyday experience in the university. Emphasizing on cooperation and innovation, we invite all students to take part in our attempt.
